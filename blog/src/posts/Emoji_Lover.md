One of my Girlfriend told me that I am Emoji hater that hurts me.  
So I decided to know about emoji and guys, you have no idea what I get 🤔🤔🤔?  
I found that 90% or more than 90% of people don't know the real meaning of emoji and using it like a pro but they are Noob 😏😏😏.  

Even you have no idea what is the real meaning of it but still, you are using. So I am not going to let you live in the darkness.  
Here I found something great.  
Did you guys ever listen about Wikipedia?  
🙄🙄🙄  
If your answer is yes then you can read further otherwise you can enjoy another blog.  
🤐🤐🤐  

Today I am talking about **Emojipedia**.  
Wait, what? 🤔  
Yes, you read it Right.  
It is Wikipedia of Emoticon (Emoji) where you can know real mean of Emoji and you can use emoticon perfectly.  

You can also challenge or punctuate them at any point which shows that how much smart you are.  But don't be too smart because some people are just to be stupid you can't change them.  

Link -  [📙 Emojipedia — 😃 Home of Emoji Meanings 💁👌🎍😍](https://emojipedia.org/)

Bouns tip - In Windows, you can use Emoji directly by pressing **Window key** + **Period (.)**  
I sometimes use it to Commit to Github.  

I hope this tip will help you in future.
