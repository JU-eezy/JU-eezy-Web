We at JU eezy believe in **doing things**, and **not just thinking about it**.

And that's what **engineers** are for, Right? 😜 (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ **Solving problems**...

We solve problems... real life problems that **help** people in many ways. We may lack at **UI**, **Maintainence** or **Scalability** because of a small team.

Our university lacks a **development based environment** where students of different fields come together to actually **develop something** and **gain actual users**. Developing prototype is not end of story. We must try to **release it to public**.

Sometimes I wonder what **technical clubs** of our University are doing... ¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯

No offence BTW...

As we have expanded our team, we now have **new website** at [jueezy.rocks](https://jueezy.rocks/) with new features. **iOS app's** work is also in progress. Some freshers are also working in our guidance to become a **good programmer** and a **skillful Engineer**.

Anyone with **enough energy** and **willing to do something impactful** is always welcome in our team for working on **real life problems**.

Currently you are at our website's **blog** section. We encourage you to write posts to share your knowledge with colleagues. If you already write on Medium, Blogger, etc., do share same post here also to increase your **local connections** and **form useful teams**.

Soon mess food menu will also be available on website.

JU eezy is not just an app... Its a **platform** established with a vision of true **Computer Science and Engineering**. Join us and **share your knowledge**, **collaborate**, **think and create software or hardware solutions** for **existing problems nearby**.

We are also releasing **beta version** of our **Android app**.
