## Well, this review is according to me and might not be the real definition. But still it might give you an overview of which category your college falls in

### Tier 1 Colleges

These colleges are those colleges which have been already established and have an elite alumni background. These colleges are namely the network of IITs, NITs, BITs and some other colleges. They run majorly due to their students. These colleges have international links, esteem level students ( in major quantity, leaving the reserved ones) and major resources. These colleges already have that reputation and companies have a mindset to get great work forces out of these colleges.

### Tier 2 Colleges

These colleges are those which are not as greatly established as the Tier 1 colleges, but that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t have brilliant people studying there. Each year these colleges have a reputation to maintain. These institutes majorly lack in resources and student power. This is so because there majority of students are those who either failed to clear JEE or other exams or they were a bit late or took this decision in a hurry. But that doesnâ€™t mean that tier 2 college students cannot be successful. They have equal chance to succeed as that of tier 1 college student or a tier 3 college student. Success isnâ€™t a college dependent entity, itâ€™s a student dependent entity. Thus these colleges lack in resources and mostly provide a bit costly education as compared to that of some tier 1 colleges.

### Tier 3 Colleges

These colleges are those which have recently been opened and lack many things that tier 1 and 2 colleges have. These colleges attract abundant of those students who just wanted to pursue engineering due their parents or some other reason. The reason can be that they didnâ€™t want to leave their hometown or someone misguided them. But this doesnâ€™t mean that they wonâ€™t succeed. The only thing that they wonâ€™t have is the links, resources and help from seniors (in other words, student power). They would have to cover the requisite on their own and this is a positive thing that they might end up being superior that a tier 1 or a tier 2 student. The only thing is that they have to put in some extra effort.
