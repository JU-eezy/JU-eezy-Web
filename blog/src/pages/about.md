##Â Hi there.

We believe in growth of everyone. Problems we face and solve today may help someone if we share the solutions. One of the things our university lacks is beautiful stories of your big and small efforts.

Our blogs are a platform where you can share your experience with thousands of people like you.

Working on something new? Facing some issue? Need an help? Are you there to help? Just write a blog post and we gaurantee you to share your message with the entire university.

Our aim is to connect people in a better way.

We are those kind of seniors who believe in helping juniors grow. We have already gone through where juniors are today. We will be sharing useful resources, tools and great experiences which will energise you to do something useful.
